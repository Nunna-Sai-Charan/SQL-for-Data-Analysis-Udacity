Questions
1. Provide a table for all web_events associated with account name of Walmart. There should be three columns. 
Be sure to include the primary_poc, time of the event, and the channel for each event. Additionally, you might 
choose to add a fourth column to assure only Walmart events were chosen.

Query : 

SELECT a.primary_poc, w.occurred_at, w.channel, a.name
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id=w.account_id
WHERE a.name='Walmart';

2. Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their associated accounts. Your final 
table should include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the account name. Sort the accounts 
alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.

Query : 

SELECT r.name, s.name, a.name
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON r.id=s.region_id
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id=a.sales_rep_id
ORDER BY a.name;

3. Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid 
(total_amt_usd/total) for the order. Your final table should have 3 columns: region name, account name, and 
unit price. A few accounts have 0 for total, so I divided by (total + 0.01) to assure not dividing by zero.

Query : 

SELECT r.name, a.name, (o.total_amt_usd/(o.total+0.01)) as unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.region_id=r.id
JOIN accounts a
ON s.id=a.sales_rep_id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id=a.id;
