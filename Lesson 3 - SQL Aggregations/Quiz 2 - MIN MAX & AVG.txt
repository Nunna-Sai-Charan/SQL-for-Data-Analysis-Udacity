Questions: MIN, MAX, & AVERAGE

Use the SQL environment below to assist with answering the following questions. Whether you get stuck 
or you just want to double check your solutions, my answers can be found at the top of the next concept.

1. When was the earliest order ever placed? You only need to return the date.

Query :

SELECT MIN(occurred_at) 
FROM Orders;

2. Try performing the same query as in question 1 without using an aggregation function.

Query :

SELECT occurred_at
FROM Orders
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 1;

3. When did the most recent (latest) web_event occur?

Query :

SELECT MAX(occurred_at) 
FROM web_events;

4. Try to perform the result of the previous query without using an aggregation function.

Query :

SELECT occurred_at 
FROM web_events
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

5. Find the mean (AVERAGE) amount spent per order on each paper type, as well as the mean amount of each 
paper type purchased per order. Your final answer should have 6 values - one for each paper type for the 
average number of sales, as well as the average amount.

Query :

SELECT AVG(standard_qty) mean_standard, AVG(gloss_qty) mean_gloss, 
              AVG(poster_qty) mean_poster, AVG(standard_amt_usd) mean_standard_usd, 
              AVG(gloss_amt_usd) mean_gloss_usd, AVG(poster_amt_usd) mean_poster_usd
FROM orders;
