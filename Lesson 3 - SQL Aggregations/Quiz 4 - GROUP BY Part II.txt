Questions: GROUP BY Part II

Use the SQL environment below to assist with answering the following questions. Whether you get stuck or 
you just want to double check your solutions, my answers can be found at the top of the next concept.

1. For each account, determine the average amount of each type of paper they purchased across their orders. 
Your result should have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average quantity purchased 
for each of the paper types for each account.

Query :

SELECT a.name AS account_name, AVG(o.standard_qty) AS standard, AVG(o.gloss_qty) AS gloss, AVG(o.poster_qty) AS poster
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id=o.account_id
GROUP BY account_name;


2. For each account, determine the average amount spent per order on each paper type. Your result should 
have four columns - one for the account name and one for the average amount spent on each paper type.

Query :

SELECT a.name AS account_name, AVG(o.standard_amt_usd) AS standard, AVG(o.gloss_amt_usd) AS gloss, AVG(o.poster_amt_usd) AS poster
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id=o.account_id
GROUP BY account_name;

3. Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each sales rep. 
Your final table should have three columns - the name of the sales rep, the channel, and the number of 
occurrences. Order your table with the highest number of occurrences first.

Query :

SELECT s.name as Name, w.channel as Channel, COUNT(*) as occurrences
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a ON a.id=w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s ON s.id=a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.name, Channel
ORDER BY occurrences DESC;

4. Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the web_events table for each region. Your 
final table should have three columns - the region name, the channel, and the number of occurrences. Order 
your table with the highest number of occurrences first.

Query :

SELECT r.name as region, w.channel as Channel, COUNT(*) as occurrences
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a ON a.id=w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s ON s.id=a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r ON r.id=s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name, Channel
ORDER BY occurrences DESC;
