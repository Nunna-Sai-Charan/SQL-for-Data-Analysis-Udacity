Questions: DISTINCT
Use the SQL environment below to assist with answering the following questions. Whether you get stuck or 
you just want to double check your solutions, my answers can be found at the top of the next concept.

1. Use DISTINCT to test if there are any accounts associated with more than one region.

Query :

SELECT a.id as "account id", r.id as "region id", 
a.name as "account name", r.name as "region name"
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id;

-------------

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM accounts;

--------------
The above two queries have the same number of resulting rows (351), so we know that every account is 
associated with only one region. If each account was associated with more than one region, the first query 
should have returned more rows than the second query.

2. Have any sales reps worked on more than one account?

Actually all of the sales reps have worked on more than one account. The fewest number of accounts any 
sales rep works on is 3. There are 50 sales reps, and they all have more than one account. Using DISTINCT in 
the second query assures that all of the sales reps are accounted for in the first query.

Query 1 :

SELECT s.id, s.name, COUNT(*) num_accounts
FROM accounts a
JOIN sales_reps s
ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
GROUP BY s.id, s.name
ORDER BY num_accounts;

--------------------------

Query 2 : 

SELECT DISTINCT id, name
FROM sales_reps;
