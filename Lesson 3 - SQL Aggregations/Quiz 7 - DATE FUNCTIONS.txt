Questions: Working With DATEs

Use the SQL environment below to assist with answering the following questions. Whether you get stuck or 
you just want to double check your solutions, my answers can be found at the top of the next concept.

1. Find the sales in terms of total dollars for all orders in each year, ordered from greatest to least. Do you notice 
any trends in the yearly sales totals?

Query :

SELECT  DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) AS year, SUM(total_amt_usd) AS total_spent 
FROM orders
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;

----------------------------------------------

When we look at the yearly totals, you might notice that 2013 and 2017 have much smaller totals than all other 
years. If we look further at the monthly data, we see that for 2013 and 2017 there is only one month of sales for 
each of these years (12 for 2013 and 1 for 2017). Therefore, neither of these are evenly represented. Sales 
have been increasing year over year, with 2016 being the largest sales to date. At this rate, we might expect 
2017 to have the largest sales.


2. Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total dollars? Are all months evenly 
represented by the dataset?

In order for this to be 'fair', we should remove the sales from 2013 and 2017. For the same reasons as 
discussed above.

---------------------------------------------------

Query :

SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) AS Order_Date, SUM(total_amt_usd) AS total_sales
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY Order_Date
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 1;

--------------------------------------------------

The greatest sales amounts occur in December (12).


3. Which year did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all years evenly 
represented by the dataset?

Query :

SELECT DATE_PART('year', occurred_at) as Order_year, COUNT(*) AS no_of_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;

---------------------------------------------------------

Again, 2016 by far has the most amount of orders, but again 2013 and 2017 are not evenly represented to the 
other years in the dataset.


4. Which month did Parch & Posey have the greatest sales in terms of total number of orders? Are all months 
evenly represented by the dataset?

Query :

SELECT DATE_PART('month', occurred_at) as Order_month, COUNT(*) AS no_of_orders
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at BETWEEN '2014-01-01' AND '2017-01-01'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;

-------------------------------------------------------

December still has the most sales, but interestingly, November has the second most sales (but not the most 
dollar sales. To make a fair comparison from one month to another 2017 and 2013 data were removed.



5. In which month of which year did Walmart spend the most on gloss paper in terms of dollars?

Query :

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', o.occurred_at) AS Order_Month, SUM(o.gloss_amt_usd)
FROM Orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id=o.account_id
WHERE a.name='Walmart'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;

--------------------------------------------------------

May 2016 was when Walmart spent the most on gloss paper.
