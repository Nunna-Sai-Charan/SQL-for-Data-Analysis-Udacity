1) Provide the name of the sales_rep in each region with the largest amount of total_amt_usd sales.

Query :

SELECT t3.NAME as rep_name, t2.REGION as region_name, t2.max_amount as Amount
FROM 
	(SELECT REGION, MAX(TOTAL_AMOUNT) as max_amount
	FROM
		(SELECT s.name AS NAME, r.name AS REGION, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) AS TOTAL_AMOUNT
		FROM sales_reps s
		JOIN region r ON r.id = s.region_id
		JOIN accounts a ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
		JOIN orders o ON o.account_id = a.id
		GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 2 DESC) t2

JOIN 

	(SELECT s.name AS NAME, r.name AS REGION, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) AS TOTAL_AMOUNT
	FROM sales_reps s
	JOIN region r ON r.id = s.region_id
	JOIN accounts a ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
	JOIN orders o ON o.account_id = a.id
	GROUP BY 1, 2
	ORDER BY 3 DESC) t3

ON 
	t2.REGION = t3.REGION AND t3.TOTAL_AMOUNT = t2.max_amount

ORDER BY AMOUNT DESC;

2) For the region with the largest (sum) of sales total_amt_usd, how many total (count) orders were placed?

Query :

SELECT r.name AS REGION , COUNT(*) AS orders
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s ON s.region_id = r.id
JOIN accounts a ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o ON o.account_id = a.id

WHERE r.name = 
	(
	SELECT r.name AS REGION 
	FROM region r
	JOIN sales_reps s ON s.region_id = r.id
	JOIN accounts a ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
	JOIN orders o ON o.account_id = a.id
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY SUM(o.total_amt_usd) DESC
	LIMIT 1)

GROUP BY REGION;

3) How many accounts had more total purchases than the account name which has bought the most 
standard_qty paper throughout their lifetime as a customer?

Query :

SELECT COUNT(*) as no_of_accounts
FROM 
	(SELECT a.name
	FROM accounts a
	JOIN orders o ON o.account_id = a.id
	GROUP BY a.name
	HAVING SUM(o.total) > 
		(SELECT total 
		FROM
		(SELECT  a.name as account_name, 
       			SUM(o.standard_qty) AS total_std_qty, 
       			SUM(o.total) as total
		FROM orders o
		JOIN accounts a ON o.account_id = a.id
		GROUP BY 1
		ORDER BY 2 DESC
		LIMIT 1) inner_table)
	) outer_table;

4) For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) total_amt_usd, how many 
web_events did they have for each channel?

Query :

SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(w.*)
FROM web_events w
JOIN accounts a ON a.id = w.account_id
WHERE w.account_id = 
	(SELECT a.id as account_id 
	FROM accounts a
	JOIN orders o ON o.account_id = a.id
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY sum(o.total_amt_usd) DESC
	LIMIT 1)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;

NOTE : I added an ORDER BY for no real reason, and the account name to assure I was only pulling from 
one account.

5) What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?

Query :

SELECT AVG(total_spent)
FROM 
(SELECT  a.name as account_name, 
	SUM(o.total_amt_usd) AS total_spent
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10) temp;

6) What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd, including only the companies that 
spent more per order, on average, than the average of all orders.

Query :

SELECT AVG(avg_total)
FROM

(SELECT account_id, AVG(total_amt_usd) as avg_total
FROM orders 
GROUP BY 1
HAVING  AVG(total_amt_usd)>
	(SELECT AVG(total_amt_usd) FROM orders)

ORDER BY 2 DESC) temp;
