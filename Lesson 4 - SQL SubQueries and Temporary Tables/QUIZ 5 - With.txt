3) How many accounts had more total purchases than the account name which has bought the most 
standard_qty paper throughout their lifetime as a customer?

Query :

	           )

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t2;

4) For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) total_amt_usd, how many 
web_events did they have for each channel?

Query :

WITH t1 AS (SELECT a.id as acc_id, a.name as acc_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) as total
		FROM orders o
		JOIN accounts a ON o.account_id = a.id
		GROUP BY 1, 2
		ORDER BY 3 DESC
		LIMIT 1)

SELECT   a.name as account_name,

	COUNT(w.*) as no_of_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w ON w.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1, 2
HAVING a.name = (SELECT acc_name FROM t1)
ORDER BY 3 DESC;


5) What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd for the top 10 total spending accounts?

Query :

		GROUP BY 1, 2
		ORDER BY 3 DESC
		LIMIT 10)

SELECT AVG(total) FROM t1;

6) What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of total_amt_usd, including only the companies that spent 
more per order, on average, than the average of all orders.

Query :

WITH t1 AS (SELECT a.name, AVG(o.total_amt_usd) as avg_amt
	FROM orders o
	JOIN accounts a ON a.id = o.account_id
	GROUP BY 1
	HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(total_amt_usd) FROM orders)) 

SELECT AVG(avg_amt)
FROM t1;
