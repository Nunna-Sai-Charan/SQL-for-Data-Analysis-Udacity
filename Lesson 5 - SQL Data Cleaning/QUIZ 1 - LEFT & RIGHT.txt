LEFT & RIGHT Quizzes

1) In the accounts table, there is a column holding the website for each company. The last three digits specify 
what type of web address they are using. A list of extensions (and pricing) is provided here(opens in a new tab).
 Pull these extensions and provide how many of each website type exist in the accounts table.

Query :

SELECT RIGHT(website, 3) AS domain, COUNT(*) AS no_of_accounts 
FROM accounts
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

2) There is much debate about how much the name (or even the first letter of a company name)(opens in a new 
tab) matters. Use the accounts table to pull the first letter of each company name to see the distribution of 
company names that begin with each letter (or number).

Query :

SELECT LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) as first_letter, COUNT(*) as no_of_companies 
FROM accounts
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

3) Use the accounts table and a CASE statement to create two groups: one group of company names that start 
with a number and a second group of those company names that start with a letter. What proportion of 
company names start with a letter?

Query :

WITH t1 AS (SELECT UPPER(name), 
	CASE 	
		WHEN LEFT(UPPER(name), 1) in ('0','1','2','3','4','5','6','7','8','9') THEN 'number'
		ELSE 'letter'
	END as starts_with
	FROM accounts  ),

t2 AS (SELECT COUNT(*) as no_of_accounts 
	FROM t1 WHERE starts_with = 'letter'  )

SELECT   (SELECT * FROM t2) AS starts_with_letter, 
	(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1)  AS total_accounts;


There are 350 company names that start with a letter and 1 that starts with a number. This gives a ratio of 
350/351 that are company names that start with a letter or 99.7%.

4) Consider vowels as a, e, i, o, and u. What proportion of company names start with a vowel, and what percent 
start with anything else?

Query :

WITH t1 AS (SELECT name, 
	CASE 
		WHEN LEFT(LOWER(name), 1) in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') THEN 'vowel'
		ELSE 'not_a_vowel'
	END AS starts_with
	FROM accounts),

	t2 AS (SELECT COUNT(*) as vowel_count 
		FROM t1 
		WHERE starts_with = 'vowel'), 

	t3 AS (SELECT COUNT(*) as not_a_vowel_count 
		FROM t1 
		WHERE starts_with = 'not_a_vowel')

SELECT 	(SELECT * FROM t2) as VOWELS, 
	(SELECT * FROM t3) as NOT_A_VOWEL, 
	(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t1) AS total_accounts;


There are 80 company names that start with a vowel and 271 that start with other characters. Therefore 
80/351 are vowels or 22.8%. Therefore, 77.2% of company names do not start with vowels.
