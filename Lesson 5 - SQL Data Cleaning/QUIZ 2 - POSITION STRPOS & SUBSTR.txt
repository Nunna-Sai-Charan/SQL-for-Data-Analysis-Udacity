Quizzes POSITION & STRPOS

You will need to use what you have learned about LEFT & RIGHT, as well as what you know about POSITION 
or STRPOS to do the following quizzes.

1) Use the accounts table to create first and last name columns that hold the first and last names for the 
primary_poc.

Query :

SELECT   primary_poc, 
	LEFT(primary_poc, STRPOS(primary_poc, ' ')-1) as First_name, 
	RIGHT(primary_poc, LENGTH(primary_poc) - (STRPOS(primary_poc, ' '))) as Last_name
FROM accounts;

2) Now see if you can do the same thing for every rep name in the sales_reps table. Again provide first and 
last name columns.

Query :

SELECT   name,
	LEFT(name, STRPOS(name, ' ')-1) as First_name,
	RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - STRPOS(name, ' ')) as Last_name
FROM sales_reps;
