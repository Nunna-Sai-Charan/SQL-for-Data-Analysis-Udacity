1) Write a query to look at the top 10 rows to understand the columns and the raw data in the dataset called 
sf_crime_data.

Query :

SELECT * 
FROM sf_crime_data
LIMIT 10;

2) Remembering back to the lesson on dates, use the QUIZ question below to make sure you remember the format that dates should use in SQL.  

ans) YYYY - MM -- DD

3) Look at the date column in the sf_crime_data table. Notice the date is not in the correct format. 

noticed.

4) Write a query to change the data into the correct SQL date fornat. You will need to use atleast SUBSTR and 
CONCAT to perform this operation.  

Query :

SELECT    date, 
	(SUBSTR(date, 7, 4) || '-' || SUBSTR(date, 1, 2) || '-' || SUBSTR(date, 4,2)) as formatted_date 
FROM sf_crime_data LIMIT 10;

5) Once you have created a column in the correct format, use either CAST or :: to convert this to a date.

Query :

SELECT    date, 
	(SUBSTR(date, 7, 4) || '-' || SUBSTR(date, 1, 2) || '-' || SUBSTR(date, 4,2))::DATE as formatted_date 
FROM sf_crime_data LIMIT 10;
